# AMM To Lobby For Improved Cell Service

The Reeve of Piney says parts of Manitoba are being treated like a third world country. Duane Boutang is referring to what little he feels the province is doing to improve cellular service. Municipal officials from across the province have voted overwhelmingly in favour of lobbying the province for better cell service. That was the number one resolution at this year's annual convention for Association of Manitoba Municipalities.

The resolution was sponsored by the Rural Municipality of Stuartburn. Reeve Jim Swidersky says in the last year, his municipality has experienced four emergencies, including wildfires in Fall, 2011, Spring 2012 and Fall 2012 as well as an October snowstorm.

Swidersky says during wildfires this Fall, communication started without FleetNet service. "Emergency services such as fire and ambulance and emergency incident command were crippled," he says. "Trying to coordinate safe firefighting responses was very difficult and very dangerous." Swidersky says without reliable cell service, municipalities endanger the lives of residents and those in charge of protecting them in emergency situations.

"I'd like to echo Mr. Swidersky's concerns," notes Piney Reeve Duane Boutang. "We have been lobbying for cell service in the RM for twenty years, been promised many times that the government was going to look into this but that hasn't happened." Boutang notes during wildfires the last two Falls, they had to perform evacuations without the use of cell phones. Then in October during the early snowstorm, Boutang says there were parts of the municipality without power for six days and thus no telecommunication whatsoever.

The concern isn't only being expressed in the southeast. During flooding last Spring, RM of Roblin Councillor Tom Mowbray says there were some dire times as volunteers attempted to sandbag in the middle of the night without the help of cellular phones. "We also have an issue with two highways going through our municipalities and many people coming from areas where there is cell service, believing that it is there as well. And from time to time they will try emergency 911 calls and to no effect." Mowbray stresses this must get corrected before it results in a fatality.

Meanwhile, Clarence Fisher is Mayor for the Town of Snow Lake. He says they do have cellular service and because of that, a tragic plane crash earlier this month didn't end up being even worse. Fisher says when the plane went down in the fatal crash, seven people managed to escape and then used a cell phone to make a rescue call.  "The only way that those people were rescued in the end was because of a cell phone call they were able to make," says Fisher. "If it wasn't for that call, that disaster would have been much worse than it was."

AMM delegates were told Tuesday that cell service is actually non existent in some parts of the province. "We do also struggle with not just poor cell service coverage," says James Lindsay, Mayor for the Town of Lynn Lake. "We have no cell service coverage in Lynn Lake." Lindsay says to get to Lynn Lake from Thompson you have to travel across 330 kilometres of what he considers some of the roughest roads in the province. He notes the nearest cell coverage to Lynn Lake is 200 kilometres away.

But the need for cell service is much more than just for safety reasons, notes Stuartburn Councillor Konrad Narth. He notes municipalities in the southeast are among the fastest growing RM's in the province. But Narth stresses economic development is difficult when business owners can not depend on cell service.

Ritchot Mayor Bob Stefaniuk, who is an Eastern Rural Board Member for AMM says cellular phones should be a universal service. "I hope that it is realized that cell service in this day and age is a necessity," he says.

Delegates voted 96% in favour Tuesday of lobbying the province for improved cell service.
